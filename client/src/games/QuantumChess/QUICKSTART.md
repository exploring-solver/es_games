## ⚛️ Key Quantum Concepts

### Superposition 🌊
**What it is**: Piece exists in multiple places at once

**How to use**:
1. Select your piece
2. Hold SHIFT
3. Click destination
4. Piece now in 2+ places!

**Why use it**:
- Attack multiple pieces
- Defend multiple squares
- Confuse your opponent

### Measurement 👁️
**What it is**: Forces piece to choose one location

**How to use**:
1. Right-click any ghost piece
2. It collapses to one position
3. Based on probability

**When to use**:
- Eliminate opponent's quantum advantage
- Lock in a good position
- Before opponent captures you

### Entanglement 🔗
**What it is**: Two pieces linked together (⚛ symbol)

**How it happens**: Move pieces near each other (30% chance)

**Why it matters**: Entangled pieces affect each other when measured

### Quantum Events
Random events that occur each turn:

- **🌀 Tunneling**: Pieces phase through barriers
- **〰️ Interference**: Probabilities shift
- **⚡ Decoherence**: States collapse

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Beginners
1. Start with Tutorial mode
2. Use superposition to threaten multiple pieces
3. Measure opponent pieces to reduce their options
4. Watch the decoherence meter

### For Strategy
1. Create superpositions before opponent can measure
2. Entangle your attacking pieces
3. Force opponent to measure at bad times
4. Control the center with quantum states

### Win Conditions
- Capture opponent's king (classical checkmate)
- Force king into inescapable quantum state
- Opponent resigns

## 🏆 First Achievement Goals

Easy achievements to unlock:

1. **🌊 Quantum Leap**: Just create one superposition (SHIFT + click)
2. **👁️ Observer Effect**: Right-click any ghost piece
3. **🔗 Spooky Action**: Move pieces close together until they entangle

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What are the ghost pieces?**
A: Superposition states - the piece has a probability of being there.

**Q: What do the numbers under ghost pieces mean?**
A: Probability bars showing likelihood of the piece being there.

**Q: What is the decoherence meter?**
A: Shows quantum state stability. High = states will collapse soon.

**Q: Can I undo moves?**
A: Yes! Press Ctrl/Cmd + Z or click the undo button.

**Q: How does AI difficulty work?**
A: Higher difficulties use more quantum mechanics strategically.

**Q: Is this real quantum physics?**
A: Yes! Simplified but accurate representations of real quantum concepts.
